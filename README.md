# Multiple-output-network
Building a multiple outputs network to predict wine quality and type

# Description
In this repo we are going to build a multiple output neural network model to predict two featurs of the wine which are the wine quality (Regression) and the wine type (Binary Classification), and train the model on Wine Quality Data Set from [UCI Machin Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality), so we need to modify the data set a little bit to fit the problem by adding a feature indicating the type of the wine to each file of the data set and then concatenate the files into one dataframe.

#  Objectives:

1- Modifying the data set to fit the problem.

2- Building a multiple outputs network using tensorflow Functional API.
